# Introduction
The tutorials section will contain tutorials on how to use the various parts of the framework to do things such as:
- Create custom prefabs
- Create custom items
- Create custom recipes
- Create custom skills
- Hook into game events

Everything that you interact with will be through the various [managers](xref:JotunnLib.Managers), most of which will be Singletons that can be accessed through their `Instance` property.
