# JotunnLib
Currently, this documentation site is split into two sections.

## Source code
The source code for JotunnLib (and the accompanying test/demo mod) is available on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/jotunnlib/jotunnlib) 

## Tutorials
This section contains tutorials on how to get started with using JotunnLib, and how to create a basic mod. View it [here](tutorials/intro.md)

_Warning: Many sections are still a WIP. However, it currently contains enough information to allow you to get started. You can also refer to the [TestMod](https://github.com/jotunnlib/jotunnlib/tree/main/TestMod) to see examples in action._

## Conceptual
This section contains information about how Valheim itself works, as well as how JotunnLib interfaces with the game. There likely will not be many code examples here, but rather high level overviews of how various systems work. View it [here](conceptual/intro.md) 

## API Documentation
This section contains documentation on all of the public code within JotunnLib. View it [here](xref:JotunnLib)

_Warning: Not everything is fully documented here, please refer to the tutorial section for now to learn how to use JotunnLib._
